# Queue & Requests API Contracts

## Auth and scope

- All endpoints below require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- All endpoints are performer-scoped and project-scoped via `{project_id}`.
- Route prefix: `/api/v1/me/projects/{project_id}`

---

## Get Active Queue

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/queue`

Get active request queue for a project. **Supports ETag caching** for efficient polling.

### Headers

- `If-None-Match`: Previous ETag value (optional)

### Success response (`200`)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "song": {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Fly Me to the Moon",
        "artist": "Frank Sinatra"
      },
      "tip_amount_cents": 1500,
      "tip_amount_dollars": "15.00",
      "status": "active",
      "requester_name": null,
      "note": "Happy birthday!",
      "activated_at": "2026-02-03T12:00:00+00:00",
      "played_at": null,
      "created_at": "2026-02-03T11:55:00+00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response includes `ETag` header.**

Queue is ordered by `tip_amount_cents DESC`, then `created_at ASC`.

### Not Modified response (`304`)

No changes since last request (when `If-None-Match` matches). No body returned.

---

## Add Item to Queue (Manual)

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/queue`

Manually add an item to the active queue as an authenticated performer/project member.

### Request body (custom song)

```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "custom_title": "Crowd Favorite Mashup",
  "tip_amount_cents": 750,
  "custom_artist": "Custom Request",
  "note": "Mash two choruses if possible"
}
```

### Request body (song from repertoire)

```json
{
  "type": "repertoire_song",
  "song_id": 123,
  "tip_amount_cents": 500,
  "note": "Acoustic version"
}
```

`song_id` must belong to the selected `{projectId}` repertoire.

### Request body (original)

```json
{
  "type": "original",
  "tip_amount_cents": 0
}
```

**Validation Rules:**
- `type`: required, one of: `custom`, `repertoire_song`, `original`
- Original requests only allowed when project setting `is_accepting_original_requests` is `true`
- `tip_amount_cents`: optional for all types, defaults to `0` when omitted

### Success response (`201`)

```json
{
  "message": "Queue item added.",
  "request": {
    "id": 42,
    "song": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Crowd Favorite Mashup",
      "artist": "Custom Request"
    },
    "tip_amount_cents": 0,
    "tip_amount_dollars": "0.00",

    "note": "Mash two choruses if possible",
    "played_at": null,
    "created_at": "2026-02-14T17:10:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

**Validation failure (`422`):**
