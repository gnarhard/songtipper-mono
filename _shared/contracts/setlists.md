# Setlists + Performance API Contracts (v1.2)

## Scope and auth

- Protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Write endpoints support `Idempotency-Key`.
- Route prefix: `/api/v1/me/projects/{project_id}`.

---

## Setlists are container-only

Setlists now only represent containers for sets.
Generation method selection happens when creating each set.

Setlist routes:
- `GET /setlists`
- `POST /setlists`
- `GET /setlists/{setlistId}`
- `PUT /setlists/{setlistId}`
- `DELETE /setlists/{setlistId}`

Removed (breaking change):
- `POST /setlists/generate-smart`
- `POST /setlists/generate-strategic`

---

## Set creation methods

### Manual set

- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets`
- Request supports optional `name` and optional `order_index`.
- If `name` is omitted or blank, backend auto-labels as `Set N`.

### Smart set

- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/generate-smart`

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Set 1",
  "allow_existing_set_duplicates": false
}
```

Semantics:
- Candidate pool is full project repertoire.
- By default (`allow_existing_set_duplicates=false`), songs already present in other sets of the same setlist are excluded.
- If no candidates remain, endpoint returns `422`.
- Creates one new set containing all ranked candidates.

Ranking order:
1. Revenue: `SUM(requests.tip_amount_cents)` per song (all statuses)
2. Popularity: `COUNT(requests.id)` per song
3. Play count: `project_songs.performance_count`
4. Tie-breakers: `title ASC`, `artist ASC`, `project_song_id ASC`

### Strategic set

- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/generate-strategic`

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Set 2",
  "seed": 12345,
  "song_count": 15,
  "randomize": false,
  "allow_existing_set_duplicates": false,
  "criteria": {
    "energy_levels": ["low", "medium"],
    "eras": ["90s"],
    "genres": ["Rock"],
    "themes": ["love"]
  }
}
```

Validation/defaults:
- `song_count`: optional, `1..50`, default `15`
- `randomize`: optional, default `false`
- `allow_existing_set_duplicates`: optional, default `false`
- Enum validation for energy/era/genre/theme uses canonical values.

Semantics:
- Effective metadata:
  - Energy/genre/theme: `project_songs` override first, fallback to `songs`
  - Era: `songs.era`
- Matching is AND across fields, OR within each field.
- Genre/theme matching is case-insensitive.
- If duplicates are not allowed, songs already present in other sets are excluded.
- If filtered pool is empty, endpoint returns `422`.
- If filtered pool has fewer than `song_count`, backend creates a partial set.
- Ordering:
  - `randomize=false`: ranked by same smart ranking rules
  - `randomize=true`: deterministic seed-based shuffle, then truncate

---

## Generation response format

Both generation endpoints return:

```json
{
  "data": { "...set resource..." },
  "meta": {
    "generation": {
      "...generation summary..."
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Generation metadata is response-only for set-level generation.
- No generation metadata is persisted to `setlists` or `setlist_sets`.

---

## Manual CSV flow (mobile behavior)

Manual CSV matching is client-side:
- User pastes title-only CSV.
- Client matches titles against repertoire using normalized/fuzzy scoring.
- Auto-match: top score `>= 0.90` and margin vs second `>= 0.08`.
- Needs review: top score `>= 0.70` but ambiguous.
- Unresolved: top score `< 0.70`.
- Client shows top 3 candidates for review rows.
- Each row must be matched or skipped before apply.
- User can manually link any row to any repertoire song.
- Repeated CSV titles are treated as explicit skipped duplicates after first occurrence.

Manual apply sequence:
1. Create set via `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets`.
2. Bulk add resolved song IDs in CSV order via `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs/bulk`.

---

## Existing set/song routes

Sets:
- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets`
- `PUT /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}`
- `DELETE /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}`

Set songs:
- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs`
- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs/bulk`
- `PUT /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs/{songId}`
- `PUT /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs/reorder`
- `DELETE /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs/{songId}`
- `POST /setlists/{setlistId}/sets/{setId}/songs/import-text`

Delete behavior:
- Remaining sets are always reindexed so `order_index` stays contiguous (`0..N-1`).
- Default-numbered titles (`Set <number>`) are renumbered sequentially.

---

## Performance sessions

Routes:
- `POST /performances/start`
- `POST /performances/stop`
- `GET /performances/current`
- `POST /performances/current/complete`
- `POST /performances/current/skip`
- `POST /performances/current/random`

Rules:
- Exactly one active session per project.
- Starting while active returns `409 Conflict`.
- Session mode: `manual` or `smart`.
- `complete` records sequential `performed_order_index`.
- Smart mode can reorder pending items after skip/complete.
