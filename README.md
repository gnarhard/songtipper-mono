# Songtipper Monorepo

SongTipper is a performer-focused app to manage songs, setlists, charts and live audience requests.

- Purpose: Manage repertoire (songs, metadata, tags), create setlists, store charts (PDFs/images), and handle audience song requests / live queue syncing.
- Architecture: Backend API + web UI in backend/, performer mobile app in frontend/ (Flutter), and shared API/contracts in shared/. - Key features: Repertoire & metadata, setlist building, chart/file uploads, audience request queue, project-scoped auth, offline-first mobile behavior. 
- Data & contracts: Shared API schema / rules live in shared/ (source of truth for backend ↔ mobile). 
- Auth & scope: Token-based authentication with authorization scoped to a Project/band. 
- Scale & imports: Designed to support bulk imports (see database/seeders), and integrates with external metadata/enrichment as needed.

Songtipper is split into multiple repositories:

- `songtipper/` (this repo): shared files, tooling, and top-level coordination.
- `songtipper/web/`: Laravel API + marketing site.
- `songtipper/mobile_app/`: Flutter mobile app.

`web/` and `mobile_app/` are intentionally independent Git repositories and are ignored by this root repo.
